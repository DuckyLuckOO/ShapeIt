Project ShapeIT

Goal of this project : solve the shoes return problem. Every year, shoes companies lose a lot of money with returned articles, costing them between 10/20$ per returned shoes. Billions of dollars are lost, 
and I want to prevent this by creating a Computer Vision tool that finds the shape/size of your foot. Depending of the shoe model that you want to buy, the app will suggest you the right size to pick, asking you if 
you prefer it to be a bit bigger or tighter. All these recommendations will be based on collected public reviews from the official shoe websites or from Reddit, X, and more.
